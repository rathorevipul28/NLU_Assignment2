 <s> alice s adventures in wonderland by lewis carroll 1865 </s>  <s> chapter i </s>  <s> down the rabbit hole </s>  <s> alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank and of having nothing to do once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading but it had no pictures or conversations in it and what is the use of a book thought alice without pictures or conversation </s>  <s> so she was considering in her own mind as well as she could for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid whether the pleasure of making a daisy chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies when suddenly a white rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her </s>  <s> there was nothing so very remarkable in that nor did alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the rabbit say to itself oh dear </s>  <s> oh dear </s>  <s> i shall be late </s>  <s> when she thought it over afterwards it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this but at the time it all seemed quite natural but when the rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat pocket and looked at it and then hurried on alice started to her feet for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat pocket or a watch to take out of it and burning with curiosity she ran across the field after it and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit hole under the hedge </s>  <s> in another moment down went alice after it never once considering how in the world she was to get out again </s>  <s> the rabbit hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way and then dipped suddenly down so suddenly that alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well </s>  <s> either the well was very deep or she fell very slowly for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next </s>  <s> first she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to but it was too dark to see anything then she looked at the sides of the well and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book shelves here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs </s>  <s> she took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed it was labelled orange marmalade but to her great disappointment it was empty she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it </s>  <s> well </s>  <s> thought alice to herself after such a fall as this i shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs </s>  <s> how brave they ll all think me at home </s>  <s> why i wouldn t say anything about it even if i fell off the top of the house </s>  <s> which was very likely true </s>  <s> down down down </s>  <s> would the fall never come to an end </s>  <s> i wonder how many miles i ve fallen by this time </s>  <s> she said aloud </s>  <s> i must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth </s>  <s> let me see that would be four thousand miles down i think for you see alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge as there was no one to listen to her still it was good practice to say it over yes that s about the right distance but then i wonder what latitude or longitude i ve got to </s>  <s> alice had no idea what latitude was or longitude either but thought they were nice grand words to say </s>  <s> presently she began again </s>  <s> i wonder if i shall fall right through the earth </s>  <s> how funny it ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward </s>  <s> the antipathies i think she was rather glad there was no one listening this time as it didn t sound at all the right word but i shall have to ask them what the name of the country is you know </s>  <s> please ma am is this new zealand or australia </s>  <s> and she tried to curtsey as she spoke fancy curtseying as you re falling through the air </s>  <s> do you think you could manage it </s>  <s> and what an ignorant little girl she ll think me for asking </s>  <s> no it ll never do to ask perhaps i shall see it written up somewhere </s>  <s> down down down </s>  <s> there was nothing else to do so alice soon began talking again </s>  <s> dinah ll miss me very much to night i should think </s>  <s> dinah was the cat </s>  <s> i hope they ll remember her saucer of milk at tea time </s>  <s> dinah my dear </s>  <s> i wish you were down here with me </s>  <s> there are no mice in the air i m afraid but you might catch a bat and that s very like a mouse you know </s>  <s> but do cats eat bats i wonder </s>  <s> and here alice began to get rather sleepy and went on saying to herself in a dreamy sort of way do cats eat bats </s>  <s> do cats eat bats </s>  <s> and sometimes do bats eat cats </s>  <s> for you see as she couldn t answer either question it didn t much matter which way she put it </s>  <s> she felt that she was dozing off and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with dinah and saying to her very earnestly now dinah tell me the truth did you ever eat a bat </s>  <s> when suddenly thump </s>  <s> thump </s>  <s> down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves and the fall was over </s>  <s> alice was not a bit hurt and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment she looked up but it was all dark overhead before her was another long passage and the white rabbit was still in sight hurrying down it </s>  <s> there was not a moment to be lost away went alice like the wind and was just in time to hear it say as it turned a corner oh my ears and whiskers how late it s getting </s>  <s> she was close behind it when she turned the corner but the rabbit was no longer to be seen she found herself in a long low hall which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof </s>  <s> there were doors all round the hall but they were all locked and when alice had been all the way down one side and up the other trying every door she walked sadly down the middle wondering how she was ever to get out again </s>  <s> suddenly she came upon a little three legged table all made of solid glass there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key and alice s first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall but alas </s>  <s> either the locks were too large or the key was too small but at any rate it would not open any of them </s>  <s> however on the second time round she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high she tried the little golden key in the lock and to her great delight it fitted </s>  <s> alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage not much larger than a rat hole she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw </s>  <s> how she longed to get out of that dark hall and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains but she could not even get her head through the doorway and even if my head would go through thought poor alice it would be of very little use without my shoulders </s>  <s> oh how i wish i could shut up like a telescope </s>  <s> i think i could if i only know how to begin </s>  <s> for you see so many out of the way things had happened lately that alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible </s>  <s> there seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door so she went back to the table half hoping she might find another key on it or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes this time she found a little bottle on it which certainly was not here before said alice and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label with the words drink me beautifully printed on it in large letters </s>  <s> it was all very well to say drink me but the wise little alice was not going to do that in a hurry </s>  <s> no i ll look first she said and see whether it s marked poison or not for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them such as that a red hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife it usually bleeds and she had never forgotten that if you drink much from a bottle marked poison it is almost certain to disagree with you sooner or later </s>  <s> however this bottle was not marked poison so alice ventured to taste it and finding it very nice it had in fact a sort of mixed flavour of cherry tart custard pine apple roast turkey toffee and hot buttered toast she very soon finished it off </s>  <s>  </s>  <s>  </s>  <s>  </s>  <s> what a curious feeling </s>  <s> said alice i must be shutting up like a telescope </s>  <s> and so it was indeed she was now only ten inches high and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden </s>  <s> first however she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further she felt a little nervous about this for it might end you know said alice to herself in my going out altogether like a candle </s>  <s> i wonder what i should be like then </s>  <s> and she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing </s>  <s> after a while finding that nothing more happened she decided on going into the garden at once but alas for poor alice </s>  <s> when she got to the door she found she had forgotten the little golden key and when she went back to the table for it she found she could not possibly reach it she could see it quite plainly through the glass and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table but it was too slippery and when she had tired herself out with trying the poor little thing sat down and cried </s>  <s> come there s no use in crying like that </s>  <s> said alice to herself rather sharply i advise you to leave off this minute </s>  <s> she generally gave herself very good advice though she very seldom followed it and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people </s>  <s> but it s no use now thought poor alice to pretend to be two people </s>  <s> why there s hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person </s>  <s> soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table she opened it and found in it a very small cake on which the words eat me were beautifully marked in currants </s>  <s> well i ll eat it said alice and if it makes me grow larger i can reach the key and if it makes me grow smaller i can creep under the door so either way i ll get into the garden and i don t care which happens </s>  <s> she ate a little bit and said anxiously to herself which way </s>  <s> which way </s>  <s> holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size to be sure this generally happens when one eats cake but alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out of the way things to happen that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way </s>  <s> so she set to work and very soon finished off the cake </s>  <s>  </s>  <s>  </s>  <s>  </s>  <s> chapter ii </s>  <s> the pool of tears </s>  <s> curiouser and curiouser </s>  <s> cried alice she was so much surprised that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good english now i m opening out like the largest telescope that ever was </s>  <s> good bye feet </s>  <s> for when she looked down at her feet they seemed to be almost out of sight they were getting so far off </s>  <s> oh my poor little feet i wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now dears </s>  <s> i m sure _i_ shan t be able </s>  <s> i shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you you must manage the best way you can but i must be kind to them thought alice or perhaps they won t walk the way i want to go </s>  <s> let me see i ll give them a new pair of boots every christmas </s>  <s> and she went on planning to herself how she would manage it </s>  <s> they must go by the carrier she thought and how funny it ll seem sending presents to one s own feet </s>  <s> and how odd the directions will look </s>  <s> alice s right foot esq </s>  <s> hearthrug near the fender with alice s love </s>  <s> oh dear what nonsense i m talking </s>  <s> just then her head struck against the roof of the hall in fact she was now more than nine feet high and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door </s>  <s> poor alice </s>  <s> it was as much as she could do lying down on one side to look through into the garden with one eye but to get through was more hopeless than ever she sat down and began to cry again </s>  <s> you ought to be ashamed of yourself said alice a great girl like you she might well say this to go on crying in this way </s>  <s> stop this moment i tell you </s>  <s> but she went on all the same shedding gallons of tears until there was a large pool all round her about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall </s>  <s> after a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming </s>  <s> it was the white rabbit returning splendidly dressed with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other he came trotting along in a great hurry muttering to himself as he came oh </s>  <s> the duchess the duchess </s>  <s> oh </s>  <s> won t she be savage if i ve kept her waiting </s>  <s> alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one so when the rabbit came near her she began in a low timid voice if you please sir the rabbit started violently dropped the white kid gloves and the fan and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go </s>  <s> alice took up the fan and gloves and as the hall was very hot she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking dear dear </s>  <s> how queer everything is to day </s>  <s> and yesterday things went on just as usual </s>  <s> i wonder if i ve been changed in the night </s>  <s> let me think was i the same when i got up this morning </s>  <s> i almost think i can remember feeling a little different </s>  <s> but if i m not the same the next question is who in the world am i </s>  <s> ah that s the great puzzle </s>  <s> and she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself to see if she could have been changed for any of them </s>  <s> i m sure i m not ada she said for her hair goes in such long ringlets and mine doesn t go in ringlets at all and i m sure i can t be mabel for i know all sorts of things and she oh </s>  <s> she knows such a very little </s>  <s> besides she s she and i m i and oh dear how puzzling it all is </s>  <s> i ll try if i know all the things i used to know </s>  <s> let me see four times five is twelve and four times six is thirteen and four times seven is oh dear </s>  <s> i shall never get to twenty at that rate </s>  <s> however the multiplication table doesn t signify let s try geography </s>  <s> london is the capital of paris and paris is the capital of rome and rome no that s all wrong i m certain </s>  <s> i must have been changed for mabel </s>  <s> i ll try and say how doth the little and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons and began to repeat it but her voice sounded hoarse and strange and the words did not come the same as they used to do </s>  <s> how doth the little crocodile improve his shining tail and pour the waters of the nile on every golden scale </s>  <s> how cheerfully he seems to grin how neatly spread his claws and welcome little fishes in with gently smiling jaws </s>  <s> i m sure those are not the right words said poor alice and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on i must be mabel after all and i shall have to go and live in that poky little house and have next to no toys to play with and oh </s>  <s> ever so many lessons to learn </s>  <s> no i ve made up my mind about it if i m mabel i ll stay down here </s>  <s> it ll be no use their putting their heads down and saying come up again dear </s>  <s> i shall only look up and say who am i then </s>  <s> tell me that first and then if i like being that person i ll come up if not i ll stay down here till i m somebody else but oh dear </s>  <s> cried alice with a sudden burst of tears i do wish they would put their heads down </s>  <s> i am so very tired of being all alone here </s>  <s> as she said this she looked down at her hands and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the rabbit s little white kid gloves while she was talking </s>  <s> how can i have done that </s>  <s> she thought </s>  <s> i must be growing small again </s>  <s> she got up and went to the table to measure herself by it and found that as nearly as she could guess she was now about two feet high and was going on shrinking rapidly she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding and she dropped it hastily just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether </s>  <s> that was a narrow escape </s>  <s> said alice a good deal frightened at the sudden change but very glad to find herself still in existence and now for the garden </s>  <s> and she ran with all speed back to the little door but alas </s>  <s> the little door was shut again and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before and things are worse than ever thought the poor child for i never was so small as this before never </s>  <s> and i declare it s too bad that it is </s>  <s> as she said these words her foot slipped and in another moment splash </s>  <s> she was up to her chin in salt water </s>  <s> her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea and in that case i can go back by railway she said to herself </s>  <s> alice had been to the seaside once in her life and had come to the general conclusion that wherever you go to on the english coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea some children digging in the sand with wooden spades then a row of lodging houses and behind them a railway station </s>  <s> however she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high </s>  <s> i wish i hadn t cried so much </s>  <s> said alice as she swam about trying to find her way out </s>  <s> i shall be punished for it now i suppose by being drowned in my own tears </s>  <s> that will be a queer thing to be sure </s>  <s> however everything is queer to day </s>  <s> just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off and she swam nearer to make out what it was at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus but then she remembered how small she was now and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself </s>  <s> would it be of any use now thought alice to speak to this mouse </s>  <s> everything is so out of the way down here that i should think very likely it can talk at any rate there s no harm in trying </s>  <s> so she began o mouse do you know the way out of this pool </s>  <s> i am very tired of swimming about here o mouse </s>  <s> alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse she had never done such a thing before but she remembered having seen in her brother s latin grammar a mouse of a mouse to a mouse a mouse o mouse </s>  <s> the mouse looked at her rather inquisitively and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes but it said nothing </s>  <s> perhaps it doesn t understand english thought alice i daresay it s a french mouse come over with william the conqueror </s>  <s> for with all her knowledge of history alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened </s>  <s> so she began again ou est ma chatte </s>  <s> which was the first sentence in her french lesson book </s>  <s> the mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water and seemed to quiver all over with fright </s>  <s> oh i beg your pardon </s>  <s> cried alice hastily afraid that she had hurt the poor animal s feelings </s>  <s> i quite forgot you didn t like cats </s>  <s> not like cats </s>  <s> cried the mouse in a shrill passionate voice </s>  <s> would you like cats if you were me </s>  <s> well perhaps not said alice in a soothing tone don t be angry about it </s>  <s> and yet i wish i could show you our cat dinah i think you d take a fancy to cats if you could only see her </s>  <s> she is such a dear quiet thing alice went on half to herself as she swam lazily about in the pool and she sits purring so nicely by the fire licking her paws and washing her face and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse and she s such a capital one for catching mice oh i beg your pardon </s>  <s> cried alice again for this time the mouse was bristling all over and she felt certain it must be really offended </s>  <s> we won t talk about her any more if you d rather not </s>  <s> we indeed </s>  <s> cried the mouse who was trembling down to the end of his tail </s>  <s> as if i would talk on such a subject </s>  <s> our family always hated cats nasty low vulgar things </s>  <s> don t let me hear the name again </s>  <s> i won t indeed </s>  <s> said alice in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation </s>  <s> are you are you fond of of dogs </s>  <s> the mouse did not answer so alice went on eagerly there is such a nice little dog near our house i should like to show you </s>  <s> a little bright eyed terrier you know with oh such long curly brown hair </s>  <s> and it ll fetch things when you throw them and it ll sit up and beg for its dinner and all sorts of things i can t remember half of them and it belongs to a farmer you know and he says it s so useful it s worth a hundred pounds </s>  <s> he says it kills all the rats and oh dear </s>  <s> cried alice in a sorrowful tone i m afraid i ve offended it again </s>  <s> for the mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went </s>  <s> so she called softly after it mouse dear </s>  <s> do come back again and we won t talk about cats or dogs either if you don t like them </s>  <s> when the mouse heard this it turned round and swam slowly back to her its face was quite pale with passion alice thought and it said in a low trembling voice let us get to the shore and then i ll tell you my history and you ll understand why it is i hate cats and dogs </s>  <s> it was high time to go for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it there were a duck and a dodo a lory and an eaglet and several other curious creatures </s>  <s> alice led the way and the whole party swam to the shore </s>  <s> chapter iii </s>  <s> a caucus race and a long tale </s>  <s> they were indeed a queer looking party that assembled on the bank the birds with draggled feathers the animals with their fur clinging close to them and all dripping wet cross and uncomfortable </s>  <s> the first question of course was how to get dry again they had a consultation about this and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to alice to find herself talking familiarly with them as if she had known them all her life </s>  <s> indeed she had quite a long argument with the lory who at last turned sulky and would only say i am older than you and must know better and this alice would not allow without knowing how old it was and as the lory positively refused to tell its age there was no more to be said </s>  <s> at last the mouse who seemed to be a person of authority among them called out sit down all of you and listen to me </s>  <s> i ll soon make you dry enough </s>  <s> they all sat down at once in a large ring with the mouse in the middle </s>  <s> alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon </s>  <s> ahem </s>  <s> said the mouse with an important air are you all ready </s>  <s> this is the driest thing i know </s>  <s> silence all round if you please </s>  <s> william the conqueror whose cause was favoured by the pope was soon submitted to by the english who wanted leaders and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest </s>  <s> edwin and morcar the earls of mercia and northumbria </s>  <s> ugh </s>  <s> said the lory with a shiver </s>  <s> i beg your pardon </s>  <s> said the mouse frowning but very politely did you speak </s>  <s> not i </s>  <s> said the lory hastily </s>  <s> i thought you did said the mouse </s>  <s> i proceed </s>  <s> edwin and morcar the earls of mercia and northumbria declared for him and even stigand the patriotic archbishop of canterbury found it advisable </s>  <s> found what </s>  <s> said the duck </s>  <s> found it the mouse replied rather crossly of course you know what it means </s>  <s> i know what it means well enough when i find a thing said the duck it s generally a frog or a worm </s>  <s> the question is what did the archbishop find </s>  <s> the mouse did not notice this question but hurriedly went on found it advisable to go with edgar atheling to meet william and offer him the crown </s>  <s> william s conduct at first was moderate </s>  <s> but the insolence of his normans how are you getting on now my dear </s>  <s> it continued turning to alice as it spoke </s>  <s> as wet as ever said alice in a melancholy tone it doesn t seem to dry me at all </s>  <s> in that case said the dodo solemnly rising to its feet i move that the meeting adjourn for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies </s>  <s> speak english </s>  <s> said the eaglet </s>  <s> i don t know the meaning of half those long words and what s more i don t believe you do either </s>  <s> and the eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile some of the other birds tittered audibly </s>  <s> what i was going to say said the dodo in an offended tone was that the best thing to get us dry would be a caucus race </s>  <s> what is a caucus race </s>  <s> said alice not that she wanted much to know but the dodo had paused as if it thought that somebody ought to speak and no one else seemed inclined to say anything </s>  <s> why said the dodo the best way to explain it is to do it </s>  <s> and as you might like to try the thing yourself some winter day i will tell you how the dodo managed it </s>  <s> first it marked out a race course in a sort of circle the exact shape doesn t matter it said and then all the party were placed along the course here and there </s>  <s> there was no one two three and away but they began running when they liked and left off when they liked so that it was not easy to know when the race was over </s>  <s> however when they had been running half an hour or so and were quite dry again the dodo suddenly called out the race is over </s>  <s> and they all crowded round it panting and asking but who has won </s>  <s> this question the dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead the position in which you usually see shakespeare in the pictures of him while the rest waited in silence </s>  <s> at last the dodo said everybody has won and all must have prizes </s>  <s> but who is to give the prizes </s>  <s> quite a chorus of voices asked </s>  <s> why she of course said the dodo pointing to alice with one finger and the whole party at once crowded round her calling out in a confused way prizes </s>  <s> prizes </s>  <s> alice had no idea what to do and in despair she put her hand in her pocket and pulled out a box of comfits luckily the salt water had not got into it and handed them round as prizes </s>  <s> there was exactly one a piece all round </s>  <s> but she must have a prize herself you know said the mouse </s>  <s> of course the dodo replied very gravely </s>  <s> what else have you got in your pocket </s>  <s> he went on turning to alice </s>  <s> only a thimble said alice sadly </s>  <s> hand it over here said the dodo </s>  <s> then they all crowded round her once more while the dodo solemnly presented the thimble saying we beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble and when it had finished this short speech they all cheered </s>  <s> alice thought the whole thing very absurd but they all looked so grave that she did not dare to laugh and as she could not think of anything to say she simply bowed and took the thimble looking as solemn as she could </s>  <s> the next thing was to eat the comfits this caused some noise and confusion as the large birds complained that they could not taste theirs and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back </s>  <s> however it was over at last and they sat down again in a ring and begged the mouse to tell them something more </s>  <s> you promised to tell me your history you know said alice and why it is you hate c and d she added in a whisper half afraid that it would be offended again </s>  <s> mine is a long and a sad tale </s>  <s> said the mouse turning to alice and sighing </s>  <s> it is a long tail certainly said alice looking down with wonder at the mouse s tail but why do you call it sad </s>  <s> and she kept on puzzling about it while the mouse was speaking so that her idea of the tale was something like this </s>  <s> fury said to a mouse that he met in the house let us both go to law i will prosecute you come i ll take no denial we must have a trial for really this morning i ve nothing to do </s>  <s> said the mouse to the cur such a trial dear sir with no jury or judge would be wasting our breath </s>  <s> i ll be judge i ll be jury said cunning old fury i ll try the whole cause and condemn you to death </s>  <s> you are not attending </s>  <s> said the mouse to alice severely </s>  <s> what are you thinking of </s>  <s> i beg your pardon said alice very humbly you had got to the fifth bend i think </s>  <s> i had not </s>  <s> cried the mouse sharply and very angrily </s>  <s> a knot </s>  <s> said alice always ready to make herself useful and looking anxiously about her </s>  <s> oh do let me help to undo it </s>  <s> i shall do nothing of the sort said the mouse getting up and walking away </s>  <s> you insult me by talking such nonsense </s>  <s> i didn t mean it </s>  <s> pleaded poor alice </s>  <s> but you re so easily offended you know </s>  <s> the mouse only growled in reply </s>  <s> please come back and finish your story </s>  <s> alice called after it and the others all joined in chorus yes please do </s>  <s> but the mouse only shook its head impatiently and walked a little quicker </s>  <s> what a pity it wouldn t stay </s>  <s> sighed the lory as soon as it was quite out of sight and an old crab took the opportunity of saying to her daughter ah my dear </s>  <s> let this be a lesson to you never to lose your temper </s>  <s> hold your tongue ma </s>  <s> said the young crab a little snappishly </s>  <s> you re enough to try the patience of an oyster </s>  <s> i wish i had our dinah here i know i do </s>  <s> said alice aloud addressing nobody in particular </s>  <s> she d soon fetch it back </s>  <s> and who is dinah if i might venture to ask the question </s>  <s> said the lory </s>  <s> alice replied eagerly for she was always ready to talk about her pet dinah s our cat </s>  <s> and she s such a capital one for catching mice you can t think </s>  <s> and oh i wish you could see her after the birds </s>  <s> why she ll eat a little bird as soon as look at it </s>  <s> this speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party </s>  <s> some of the birds hurried off at once one old magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully remarking i really must be getting home the night air doesn t suit my throat </s>  <s> and a canary called out in a trembling voice to its children come away my dears </s>  <s> it s high time you were all in bed </s>  <s> on various

appeared on the other side the puppy made another rush at the stick and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it then alice thinking it was very like having a game of play with a cart horse and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet ran round the thistle again then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back and barking hoarsely all the while till at last it sat down a good way off panting with its tongue hanging out of its mouth and its great eyes half shut </s>  <s> this seemed to alice

mushroom and her eyes immediately met those of a large caterpillar that was sitting on the top with its arms folded quietly smoking a long hookah and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else </s>  <s> chapter v advice from a caterpillar </s>  <s> the caterpillar and alice looked at each other for some time in silence at last the caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth

</s>  <s> said the caterpillar contemptuously </s>  <s> who are you </s>  <s> which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation </s>  <s> alice felt a little irritated at the

piteous tone </s>  <s> and she thought of herself i wish the creatures wouldn t be so easily offended </s>  <s> you ll get used to it in time said the caterpillar and it put the hookah into its mouth

sneezing and every now and then a great crash as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces </s>  <s> please then said alice how am i to get in </s>  <s> there might be some sense in your knocking

difficulty alice found at first was in managing her flamingo she succeeded in getting its body tucked away comfortably enough under her arm with its legs hanging down but generally just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head it would twist itself round and look up in her face with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing and when she had got its head down and was going to begin again it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself and was in the act of crawling away besides all this there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to and as the doubled up soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground

to feel very uneasy to be sure she had not as yet had any dispute with the queen but she knew that it might happen any minute and then thought she what would become of me </s>  <s> they re dreadfully fond of beheading people here the great wonder is that there s any one left alive </s>  <s> she was looking about for some way of escape and wondering whether she could get away without being seen when she noticed a curious appearance in the air it puzzled her very much at first but after watching it a minute or two she made it out to be a grin and she said to herself it s the cheshire cat now i shall have somebody to talk to </s>  <s> how are you getting on </s>  <s> said the cat as soon as there was mouth enough for it to speak with </s>  <s> alice waited till the eyes appeared and then nodded </s>  <s> it s no use speaking to it she thought till its ears have come or at least one of them </s>  <s> in another minute the whole head appeared and then alice put down her flamingo and began an account of the game feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her </s>  <s> the cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight and no more of it appeared </s>  <s> i don t think they play at all fairly alice began in rather a complaining tone and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can t hear oneself speak and they don t seem to have any rules in particular at least if there are nobody attends to them and you ve no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive for instance there s the arch i ve got to go through next walking about at the other end of the ground and i should have croqueted the queen s hedgehog just now only it ran away when it saw mine coming </s>  <s> how do you like the queen </s>  <s> said the cat in a low voice </s>  <s> not at all said alice she s so extremely just then she noticed that the queen was close behind her listening so she went on likely to win that it s hardly worth while finishing the game </s>  <s> the queen smiled and passed on </s>  <s> who are you talking to </s>  <s> said the king going up to alice and looking at the cat s head with great curiosity </s>  <s> it s a friend of mine a cheshire cat said alice allow me to introduce it </s>  <s> i don t like the look of it at all said the king however it may kiss my hand if it likes </s>  <s> i d rather not the cat remarked </s>  <s> don t be impertinent said the king and don t look at me like that </s>  <s> he got behind alice as he spoke </s>  <s> a cat may look at a king said alice </s>  <s> i ve read that in some book but i don t remember where </s>  <s> well it must be removed said the king very decidedly and he called the queen who was passing at the moment my dear </s>  <s> i wish you would have this cat removed </s>  <s> the queen had only one way of settling all difficulties great or small </s>  <s> off with his head </s>  <s> she said without even looking round </s>  <s> i ll fetch the executioner myself said the king eagerly and he hurried off </s>  <s> alice thought she might as well go back and see how the game was going on as she heard the queen s voice in the distance screaming with passion </s>  <s> she had already heard her sentence three of the players to be executed for having missed their turns and she did not like the look of things at all as the game was in such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or not </s>  <s> so she went in search of her hedgehog </s>  <s> the hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog which seemed to alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other the only difficulty was that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden where alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree </s>  <s> by the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back the fight was over and both the hedgehogs were out of sight but it doesn t matter much thought alice as all the arches are gone from this side of the ground </s>  <s> so she tucked it away under her arm that it might not escape again and went back for a little more conversation with her friend </s>  <s> when she got back to the cheshire cat she was surprised to find quite a large crowd collected round it there was a dispute going on between the executioner the king and the queen who were all talking at once while all the rest were quite silent and looked very uncomfortable </s>  <s> the moment alice appeared she was appealed to by all three to settle the question and they repeated their arguments to her though as they all spoke at once she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said </s>  <s> the executioner s argument was that you couldn t cut off a head unless there was a body to cut it off from that he had never had to do such a thing before and he wasn t going to begin at his time of life </s>  <s> the king s argument was that anything that had a head could be beheaded and that you weren t to talk nonsense </s>  <s> the queen s argument was that if something wasn t done about it in less than no time she d have everybody executed all round </s>  <s> it was this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious </s>  <s> alice could think of nothing else to say but it belongs to the duchess you d better ask her about it </s>  <s> she s in prison the queen said to the executioner fetch her here </s>  <s> and the executioner went off like an arrow </s>  <s> the cat s head began fading away the moment he was gone and by the time he had come back with the duchess it had entirely disappeared so the king and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it while the rest of the party went back to the game </s>  <s> chapter ix </s>  <s> the mock turtle s story </s>  <s> you can t think how glad i am to see you again you dear old thing </s>  <s> said the duchess as she tucked her arm affectionately into alice s and they walked off together </s>  <s> alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper and thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so savage when they met in the kitchen </s>  <s> when i m a duchess she said to herself not in a very hopeful tone though i won t have any pepper in my kitchen at all </s>  <s> soup does very well without maybe it s always pepper that makes people hot tempered she went on very much pleased at having found out a new kind of rule and vinegar that makes them sour and camomile that makes them bitter and and barley sugar and such things that make children sweet tempered </s>  <s> i only wish people knew that then they wouldn t be so stingy about it you know </s>  <s> she had quite forgotten the duchess by this time and was a little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear </s>  <s> you re thinking about something my dear and that makes you forget to talk </s>  <s> i can t tell you just now what the moral of that is but i shall remember it in a bit </s>  <s> perhaps it hasn t one alice ventured to remark </s>  <s> tut tut child </s>  <s> said the duchess </s>  <s> everything s got a moral if only you can find it </s>  <s> and she squeezed herself up closer to alice s side as she spoke </s>  <s> alice did not much like keeping so close to her first because the duchess was very ugly and secondly because she was exactly the right height to rest her chin upon alice s shoulder and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin </s>  <s> however she did not like to be rude so she bore it as well as she could </s>  <s> the game s going on rather better now she said by way of keeping up the conversation a little </s>  <s> tis so said the duchess and the moral of that is oh tis love tis love that makes the world go round </s>  <s> somebody said alice whispered that it s done by everybody minding their own business </s>  <s> ah well </s>  <s> it means much the same thing said the duchess digging her sharp little chin into alice s shoulder as she added and the moral of that is take care of the sense and the sounds will take care of themselves </s>  <s> how fond she is of finding morals in things </s>  <s> alice thought to herself </s>  <s> i dare say you re wondering why i don t put my arm round your waist the duchess said after a pause the reason is that i m doubtful about the temper of your flamingo </s>  <s> shall i try the experiment </s>  <s> he might bite alice cautiously replied not feeling at all anxious to have the experiment tried </s>  <s> very true said the duchess flamingoes and mustard both bite </s>  <s> and the moral of that is birds of a feather flock together </s>  <s> only mustard isn t a bird alice remarked </s>  <s> right as usual said the duchess what a clear way you have of putting things </s>  <s> it s a mineral i think said alice </s>  <s> of course it is said the duchess who seemed ready to agree to everything that alice said there s a large mustard mine near here </s>  <s> and the moral of that is the more there is of mine the less there is of yours </s>  <s> oh i know </s>  <s> exclaimed alice who had not attended to this last remark it s a vegetable </s>  <s> it doesn t look like one but it is </s>  <s> i quite agree with you said the duchess and the moral of that is be what you would seem to be or if you d like it put more simply never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise </s>  <s> i think i should understand that better alice said very politely if i had it written down but i can t quite follow it as you say it </s>  <s> that s nothing to what i could say if i chose the duchess replied in a pleased tone </s>  <s> pray don t trouble yourself to say it any longer than that said alice </s>  <s> oh don t talk about trouble </s>  <s> said the duchess </s>  <s> i make you a present of everything i ve said as yet </s>  <s> a cheap sort of present </s>  <s> thought alice </s>  <s> i m glad they don t give birthday presents like that </s>  <s> but she did not venture to say it out loud </s>  <s> thinking again </s>  <s> the duchess asked with another dig of her sharp little chin </s>  <s> i ve a right to think said alice sharply for she was beginning to feel a little worried </s>  <s> just about as much right said the duchess as pigs have to fly and the m </s>  <s> but here to alice s great surprise the duchess s voice died away even in the middle of her favourite word moral and the arm that was linked into hers began to tremble </s>  <s> alice looked up and there stood the queen in front of them with her arms folded frowning like a thunderstorm </s>  <s> a fine day your majesty </s>  <s> the duchess began in a low weak voice </s>  <s> now i give you fair warning shouted the queen stamping on the ground as she spoke either you or your head must be off and that in about half no time </s>  <s> take your choice </s>  <s> the duchess took her choice and was gone in a moment </s>  <s> let s go on with the game the queen said to alice and alice was too much frightened to say a word but slowly followed her back to the croquet ground </s>  <s> the other guests had taken advantage of the queen s absence and were resting in the shade however the moment they saw her they hurried back to the game the queen merely remarking that a moment s delay would cost them their lives </s>  <s> all the time they were playing the queen never left off quarrelling with the other players and shouting off with his head </s>  <s> or off with her head </s>  <s> those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers who of course had to leave off being arches to do this so that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left and all the players except the king the queen and alice were in custody and under sentence of execution </s>  <s> then the queen left off quite out of breath and said to alice have you seen the mock turtle yet </s>  <s> no said alice </s>  <s> i don t even know what a mock turtle is </s>  <s> it s the thing mock turtle soup is made from said the queen </s>  <s> i never saw one or heard of one said alice </s>  <s> come on then said the queen and he shall tell you his history </s>  <s> as they walked off together alice heard the king say in a low voice to the company generally you are all pardoned </s>  <s> come that s a good thing </s>  <s> she said to herself for she had felt quite unhappy at the number of executions the queen had ordered </s>  <s> they very soon came upon a gryphon lying fast asleep in the sun </s>  <s> if you don t know what a gryphon is look at the picture </s>  <s> up lazy thing </s>  <s> said the queen and take this young lady to see the mock turtle and to hear his history </s>  <s> i must go back and see after some executions i have ordered and she walked off leaving alice alone with the gryphon </s>  <s> alice did not quite like the look of the creature but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage queen so she waited </s>  <s> the gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes then it watched the queen till she was out of sight then it chuckled </s>  <s> what fun </s>  <s> said the gryphon half to itself half to alice </s>  <s> what is the fun </s>  <s> said alice </s>  <s> why she said the gryphon </s>  <s> it s all her fancy that they never executes nobody you know </s>  <s> come on </s>  <s> everybody says come on </s>  <s> here thought alice as she went slowly after it i never was so ordered about in all my life never </s>  <s> they had not gone far before they saw the mock turtle in the distance sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock and as they came nearer alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break </s>  <s> she pitied him deeply </s>  <s> what is his sorrow </s>  <s> she asked the gryphon and the gryphon answered very nearly in the same words as before it s all his fancy that he hasn t got no sorrow you know </s>  <s> come on </s>  <s> so they went up to the mock turtle who looked at them with large eyes full of tears but said nothing </s>  <s> this here young lady said the gryphon she wants for to know your history she do </s>  <s> i ll tell it her said the mock turtle in a deep hollow tone sit down both of you and don t speak a word till i ve finished </s>  <s> so they sat down and nobody spoke for some minutes </s>  <s> alice thought to herself i don t see how he can even finish if he doesn t begin </s>  <s> but she waited patiently </s>  <s> once said the mock turtle at last with a deep sigh i was a real turtle </s>  <s> these words were followed by a very long silence broken only by an occasional exclamation of hjckrrh </s>  <s> from the gryphon and the constant heavy sobbing of the mock turtle </s>  <s> alice was very nearly getting up and saying thank you sir for your interesting story but she could not help thinking there must be more to come so she sat still and said nothing </s>  <s> when we were little the mock turtle went on at last more calmly though still sobbing a little now and then we went to school in the sea </s>  <s> the master was an old turtle we used to call him tortoise </s>  <s> why did you call him tortoise if he wasn t one </s>  <s> alice asked </s>  <s> we called him tortoise because he taught us said the mock turtle angrily really you are very dull </s>  <s> you ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question added the gryphon and then they both sat silent and looked at poor alice who felt ready to sink into the earth </s>  <s> at last the gryphon said to the mock turtle drive on old fellow </s>  <s> don t be all day about it </s>  <s> and he went on in these words </s>  <s> yes we went to school in the sea though you mayn t believe it </s>  <s> i never said i didn t </s>  <s> interrupted alice </s>  <s> you did said the mock turtle </s>  <s> hold your tongue </s>  <s> added the gryphon before alice could speak again </s>  <s> the mock turtle went on </s>  <s> we had the best of educations in fact we went to school every day </s>  <s> i ve been to a day school too said alice you needn t be so proud as all that </s>  <s> with extras </s>  <s> asked the mock turtle a little anxiously </s>  <s> yes said alice we learned french and music </s>  <s> and washing </s>  <s> said the mock turtle </s>  <s> certainly not </s>  <s> said alice indignantly </s>  <s> ah </s>  <s> then yours wasn t a really good school said the mock turtle in a tone of great relief </s>  <s> now at ours they had at the end of the bill french music and washing extra </s>  <s> you couldn t have wanted it much said alice living at the bottom of the sea </s>  <s> i couldn t afford to learn it </s>  <s> said the mock turtle with a sigh </s>  <s> i only took the regular course </s>  <s> what was that </s>  <s> inquired alice </s>  <s> reeling and writhing of course to begin with the mock turtle replied and then the different branches of arithmetic ambition distraction uglification and derision </s>  <s> i never heard of uglification alice ventured to say </s>  <s> what is it </s>  <s> the gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise </s>  <s> what </s>  <s> never heard of uglifying </s>  <s> it exclaimed </s>  <s> you know what to beautify is i suppose </s>  <s> yes said alice doubtfully it means to make anything prettier </s>  <s> well then the gryphon went on if you don t know what to uglify is you are a simpleton </s>  <s> alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it so she turned to the mock turtle and said what else had you to learn </s>  <s> well there was mystery the mock turtle replied counting off the subjects on his flappers mystery ancient and modern with seaography then drawling the drawling master was an old conger eel that
